**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will have a comprehensive understanding of the `<audio>` HTML element.

## The `<audio>` element

The `<audio>` element can be used in the webpage in other ways, for example, to play a background audio clip in a continuous loop.

Attributes, such as `loop`, can be set in the `<audio>` element directly or manipulated via JS. For example, the element may have its default controls shown by adding the **controls** attribute (no value is necessary).

To learn even more about what the `<audio>` element can do, here are the docs for more info: [**Audio HTML Element**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio).
